// This is an edited and modified open source code which interacts with an integrated arudino and a game controller. It can be repurposed for many different 
controller devices, with its main feature being that it convers an analog control signal to digital using a magnetic stickbox. This prevents physical wear from
limiting the accuracy and integrity of the analog inputs, especially in environments where accuracy is infinitely important.
